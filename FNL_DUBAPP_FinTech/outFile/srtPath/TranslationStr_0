{"translatedText": "I am Suleiman Abi Sultan, Abu Salim Khan, my mother Sultana Hafsa and Aisha Walid Tawfiq, a friend of Trabzon. I brought joy to my family and I brought blessings and peace to your family, but I brought sorrow to my brothers Orhan and Musa and code code Matgoi from the oppressors against us and I lived my entire childhood with even I, Suleiman, who took lessons from my Roman teachers And I was only six years old, and I loved mountains and stars, and value from high, and coloring numbers, searching for science in Istanbul, and I was ten years old. I am the reader of blessings who asks a lot and who does not convince any young people. Light with metal and stone. I quickly became aware of the real shine and the fake glossiness at first sight. I am Suleiman, who does not forget the thing he learned. I, Suleiman, became the crown prince at the age of 19, and he was in the hands of those who forgot. Today, I walk. I do not rule the honorable inheritance of Sultan Salim Khans father. I am the one who is looking for justice. With every step we take in her life, I am the tenth sultan of the Ottoman Empire"}
